# Lab-2-Git

Hey everyone! This week we learned about Pull requests and what they actually are and how we can implement them on Github. Throughout the last class, I learned a lot about the uses of Github. In my last internship, I had used Github for a lot of my coding projects, however, I was not able to get a deeper understanding of the real uses of Github. This lesson was able to teach me a lot more about what it actually can be used for and it's specific purposes.
